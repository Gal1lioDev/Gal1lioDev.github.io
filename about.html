        <p>Qatar’s National Vision aims that – by 2030 – Qatar becomes an advanced society capable of sustaining its development and providing a high standard of living for its people. Qatar’s National Vision defines the long-term goals for the country and provides a framework in which national strategies and implementation plans can be developed.

            The National Vision addresses five major challenges facing Qatar:</p>
        <ul id="lists">
            <li>Modernisation and preservation of traditions</li>
            <li>The needs of the current generation and of future generations</li>
            <li>Managed growth and uncontrolled expansion</li>
            <li>The size and quality of the expatriate labour force and the selected path of development</li>
            <li>Economic growth, social development, and environmental management</li>
        </ul>
